# GPU Marching Cubes - Developer Notes

## GPU Resource Cleanup (Building System)

**File:** `building_system/building_mesher.gd`  
**Toggle:** `ENABLE_GPU_CLEANUP` (line ~26)

### If you experience crashes during building/mesh generation:

1. Open `building_system/building_mesher.gd`
2. Find `const ENABLE_GPU_CLEANUP: bool = true`
3. Change to `false`
4. Test if crashes stop

### Background:
- The original code had GPU resource freeing disabled due to crashes
- We re-enabled it with correct freeing order (uniform_set first, then textures/sampler)
- Tested working on Godot 4.5 without crashes
- If crashes return, the freeing order may need more research

### Trade-off:
- **Cleanup ON:** No GPU memory leak
- **Cleanup OFF:** Leaks ~32KB per mesh generation (~3MB per 100 blocks placed)

## Slope-Based Cliff Rock Texture

**File:** `marching_cubes/terrain.gdshader`  
**Uniform:** `surface_cliff_threshold` (default: 10.0)

### What it does:
- Applies a rocky texture to steep surfaces (cliffs) based on surface normal angle
- Only active **above** `surface_cliff_threshold` Y level (default Y=10)
- Underground areas show raw materials (stone, ore, etc.) for gameplay clarity

### Potential Gameplay Issue:
> ⚠️ **FUTURE CONSIDERATION:** Players mining near the surface may not see the actual terrain materials (stone, ore, gravel) because the rocky cliff texture overlays them. This is purely visual enhancement and may need to:
> - Be reduced in intensity
> - Have the threshold lowered further
> - Be removed entirely if it causes confusion during early mining

### How to adjust:
1. **Change threshold:** Modify `surface_cliff_threshold` in the shader material (lower = less rocky texture near surface)
2. **Reduce intensity:** In the shader, find `cliff_mix` calculation and multiply by a value < 1.0
3. **Disable entirely:** Comment out the cliff rock blending section (lines ~190-198)

### Current behavior:
- Y 8-12: Smooth transition zone
- Y < 8: No rocky texture (shows actual materials)

## Road Edge Blending

**File:** `marching_cubes/terrain.gdshader`  
**Uniforms:** `road_edge_blend_enabled`, `road_edge_blend_width`

### Current Status:
> ⚠️ **Working but not perfect.** Road edge blending has some asymmetry due to Marching Cubes mesh boundary variations. The blend zone uses a fixed distance calculation (`procedural_road_width * 0.43`), but the actual road mesh edge varies with terrain height/slope.

### Why it's imperfect:
- Road **geometry** (mesh) is generated by density shader with smooth blending
- Road **material** (mat_id 6) is assigned with stricter bounds + height check
- The visual road edge depends on both, creating inconsistent boundaries
- Shader blend uses fixed distance, cannot adapt to per-pixel mesh variations

### Potential future fix:
- Pass actual mesh boundary info from density to terrain shader (complex)
- Or accept the current "good enough" state
