So far was not able to do much with ragdolls.
The model had to be resized/increased to 8.0 height before physical skeleton is somewhat more correct in placement.
Then you would apply physical_bone_scaler.gd resizing script to the newly created PhysicalBoneSimulator3D with scale factor of 0.24 for this specific zombie model.
Then basic ragdoll_tester.gd would be needed to apply to the root node2d for activation of the ragdoll.

It is recommended to remove small bones before testing as ragdolls still as a base not working as expected, maybe needs movement constraints.
There is a button in physical_bone_scaler.gd for that.


Using hingejoint
Enabling angular joint constraints and setting to 45.0 and -45.0 helped to progress.
Disabling male_zombie.glb "Apply Root Scale" and reimporting also was key way to progress.
Physicalbonesimulator scale factor 0.33
